Note:

We release the txt file corresponding to the rate upper limit, i.e., data associated with Fig. 5 in the paper, and showcase how to obtain the results via a jupyter notebook.

We don't provide the raw data to obtain the limit due to the file size limit. If you have interests for getting raw data, please send an enquery to yifan.wang@aei.mpg.de. I'd be happy to help to download the data.

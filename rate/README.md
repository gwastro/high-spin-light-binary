Note:

We release the txt file corresponding to the rate upper limit, i.e., data associated with Fig. 5 in the paper, and showcase how to analyze via a jupyter notebook.

We don't provide the raw data to obtain the limit due to the file size limit. However, if you have interests, please send an enquery to yifan.wang@aei.mpg.de
